# AlgoGrid
An HTML website using a canvas to display an interactive grid.
This is my first in depth use of JavaScript!

## Showcase

In order for ES Modules to run on Github Pages, builder.py is used to compress all JavaScript files together into main.js.

## Retro
Looking back on that last sentence, this is before I knew what a bundler was...

I gained a huge amount of experience and knowledge about JavaScript and the web from this project. At the time I tried my best to keep it from turning into a nice bowl of spaghetti code but alas... the comments made it readable to me at least. 

Every once and a while I would look back at this project and not know how to refactor it into a cleaner and more OOP style. Now that I have learned a great deal about TypeScript, I can clearly see a few improvements to reduce the mind wretching amount of ambiguity that lies in the code.

I have also gained experiece with various testing libraries that would be of great help in such a complex algorithmic program like this.

If I were to go back and modify this project, that is what I would do but there is more value in continuing forward than refactoring an old project.
